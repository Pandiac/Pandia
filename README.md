What is Pandia?

Pandia is a digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Pandia uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Pandia is the name of open source software which enables the use of this currency.
